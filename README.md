# Personal projects that use Processing IDE

To use these projects you must have Processing downloaded.

Each File contains a project I have made:

1. centrik
    - This is a personal interactive art piece I created, it is a recursive program that creates different pieces of art whether the user holds down the mouse or not. Try it out and make some cool art!
1. Brick Breaker
    - This is a simple brick breaker game I created, it is very simple and easy to play
1. Race Track
    - Race Track is a simultor that replicates cars on a road. The user has control of the road's layout by moving a number of points which make up a linked bezeir curve.   
1. Space Shooter
    - Space Shooter is a game I created, to run this game simply download the file and run the SpaceShooter.pde file, the other fiels in the folder are essential. You should keep them in the same folder and only run the main file, it will compile on itself.  
1. Armless Robot
    - An art piece I created for fun, very simple creation of a robot using lines and shapes.  
1. Box_POV
    - Cool art piece I have created where the camera seems to move perspective and change colour.   
1. Noise Simulator
    - This was a piece of software I had found on the internet and altered to look much cooler, it is a simulator showing a 3D environment of random noise.
1. Twirling Circles
    - A favourite art piece I created, very pointless but a cool optical illusion. This looks great on an OLED screen or projector and it is easy to get lost in the patterns and random sudden changes of the circles.
    
I hope you enjoy my ideas and projects.
