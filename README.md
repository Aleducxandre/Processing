# Personal projects that use Processing IDE

To use these projects you must have Processing downloaded.

Each File contains a project I have made:

1. centrik
    - This is a personal interactive art piece I created, it is a recursive program that creates different pieces of art whether the user holds down the mouse or not. Try it out and make some cool art!
1. Brick Breaker
    - This is a simple brick breaker game I created, it is very simple and easy to play
1. Race Track
    - Race Track is a simultor that replicates cars on a road. The user has control of the road's layout by moving a number of points which make up a linked bezeir curve.   
1. Space Shooter
    - Space Shooter is a game I created, to run this game simply download the file and run the SpaceShooter.pde file, the other fiels in the folder are essential. You should keep them in the same folder and only run the main file, it will compile on itself.  

I hope you enjoy my ideas and projects.
